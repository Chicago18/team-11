                                If you care about giving back to communities and the quality of your open source code, consider the impact your organization could have if every member contributed to open source projects they use. The transition from using open source to contributing isn't always easy, but it's important to give back.

                            <p>
                                In this workshop, you'll discover how some organizations support the open source communities they depend on, how you can scale open source programs across entire organizations, and how to encourage your team to make meaningful contributions.

                                What's the right size for a repository? When's the right time to migrate from a centralized version control system? How much of my history should I keep? If you've asked these questions, you're not alone. Moving from legacy systems introduces challenges for organizations of any size.

                                In this workshop, you'll hear from engineers who have moved repositories of all varieties, how they did it, and what types of guardrails they had in place for smooth migrations.

                                Maintaining an open source project means you're often coding less and supporting contributors more—and taking on a set of tasks that maintainers rarely plan for. For some, this leads to burnout rather than thriving projects.

                                This workshop brings you experienced project maintainers who are ready to discuss the documentation, processes, and hard questions that need to be answered when preparing a project. Most importantly, you'll learn how to create a healthy community that helps move your project forward while safeguarding your sanity.

                                GitHub's API covers just about everything you see and do on GitHub. Integrations have the power to go far beyond setting a commit status or responding to a pull request.

                            <p>
                                In this workshop, you'll learn how others have built powerful integrations using the GitHub API and how you can create a smooth experience for developers with tightly-woven integrations.

                                Knowing how to open pull request and commit are great first steps, but designing new workflows as your team moves to Git and GitHub is a big task.

                                This workshop will provide you with examples of workflows that Git and GitHub make possible and leave you with everything you need to implement the right strategies for your team.

                                Vulnerabilities that put data or finances at risk are any developer's worst nightmare. But abuse vectors that lead to customers being harassed, doxxed, traumatized, or threatened are just as important to a community's experience—and are often neglected.

                                This workshop will introduce programmers of all skill levels to common ways that web applications can be exploited to harm others and some options for addressing them. We'll look at examples of software from pop culture with abuse vectors and collaborate on possible solutions.

                                As any Git superuser can tell you, when a repository has many contributors and a large commit history, it can get disorganized quickly.

                                Now, every company is a technology company. And with the best, most widely-used technologies coming from open source projects, it's essential that teams think about more than their code base. Companies that use open source methodologies are creating collaborative communities, increasing transparency, and shipping at unprecedented speeds.

                                GitHub can help you access lots of data about projects and developers in your organization. Data can be a powerful tool in tracking productivity, but it can also encourage unproductive behaviors. Knowing what to track is often the biggest challenge.

                                In this workshop, you'll learn which metrics your team should be watching, and how to collect and visualize them to help developers work more efficiently and collaboratively.

                                When working on larger software projects—like autonomous driving or complex embedded controller logics—you’ll eventually need to decide how to organize your code base. Whether you choose multiple Git repositories or a mono repo, you’ll have to deal with both pros and cons. Even if it’s the cleaner solution from a configuration management perspective, the additional complexity of handling a multi-repository setup often rules it out.<br><br>The team at Continental recently switched from a mono to a multi-repository approach because of our code base’s requirements for embedded development. They have to deal with strongly dependent and optimized code while supporting many variants in product configuration.<br><br>With MegaMerger, Continental solved the issue of delivering change sets that are spread across multiple repositories and can be built, tested, and merged as part of an automatic transaction. Their goal was to apply the pull request model to repositories that are connected with submodules or a repository configuration. Their GitHub App controls and synchronizes multiple pull requests without imposing any special requirements on the underlying build system to obtain the change set.<br><br>Get an introduction to the given automotive embedded environment that lead to Continental’s decision, along with the workflow schema and the design decision implemented in the MegaMerger toolset. You’ll also see what limitations the team is facing, learn how to deal with distributed code bases, and see what’s possible when integrating with GitHub.

                                What if your "Hello World" project could have an impact on the real world? What if your first code could control a structure like the ARCH?<br><br>Sponsored by Mozilla for close to 2,000 attendees at GitHub Universe 2018, the ARCH Light Art Installation is the first truly immersive "code expressed into art" experience.  Anyone can contribute to this interactive, multi-sensory installation—the first of its kind to visualize the power of JavaScript and WebAssembly as animation with over 30,000 colored LEDs.<br><br>In this talk, we’ll start with the narrative of collaboration with experiential artist Ian Brill who created the ARCH piece and progress into how code can express 3D Space (perhaps 4D if you include time) in computing power. Then we’ll dive into why this structure is a good mental model for how WebAssembly and JavaScript work together through something called linear memory.

                                Continuous Integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. When you commit code more often, it can raise errors much sooner which is why this talk will introduce you to how you can leverage the new Checks API alongside your CI to improve your development workflow and reducing the amount of cognitive load code a developer needs for debugging to find the source of the error.

                                Open source security management, licensing compliance, and quality assessment, are becoming essential for developers working to build software faster. Developers are required to validate the security of open source components they use, and importantly, prioritize how they handle actual security vulnerabilities, enabling a significant reduction of security vulnerability risk while maintaining productivity. On average, more than 80 percent of reported security vulnerabilities in open source libraries are not referenced by the developers’ code, but there's little visibility between the two.<br><br>In this session, you'll learn how functions such as vulnerability discovery and impact analysis can help developers focus on real security risks that affect their applications, pinpointing the calls to vulnerable code, down to the pertinent filename and line number. You'll also see how to use security checks in GitHub to tap into the normal SDLC working environment with integrations like the Checks API.

                                Modern microcontrollers make it easy to bring your code out of the digital world and into the physical. Learn how any software engineer can get started with microcontroller programming, beginning with the Particle Photon board, a wifi-enabled microcontroller. You already know how to code. Now you just need a basic understanding of circuits and familiarity with the latest tools. Let’s pick up our soldering irons and put on safety goggles—it’s time to make things.

                                The future of infrastructure is bright, and new tools let us focus on who we’re building for instead of how we're building. At its heart, infrastructure exists to solve peoples' problems. The key to choosing the right tools is seeing infrastructure for what it is: A product used by people.<br><br>This talk presents the story of Moda—GitHub's internal service platform. Moda is a set of tools, practices, and ideas for running software on Kubernetes. We’ll share how we approached big infrastructure changes, what has worked well, and why we made the decisions we did. Our success is rooted in treating infrastructure like a product, remembering that we build tools to enable other developers, and focusing on what can help them build the future of software.<br><br>This talk is about the big picture, not the day-to-day details, so you won’t need prior knowledge of containers or Kubernetes to participate or benefit.

                                While women comprised 37% of computer science graduates in 1984, only 18% pursue the field today. Increasing the number of women who can code and specifically in the growing field of artificial intelligence, is critical. In this session, Laura Heisman, GitHub's VP of Communications will interview Fiona Tan, Senior Vice President of Customer Technology at Walmart Labs on why women are fundamental to the future of the self-learning algorithms that power A.I. and why closing the gender gap in STEM is not only important for business, but important for society.

                                In music, a mashup is a song created by blending two or more existing songs into a whole new piece. The best mashups are seamless and natural. They’re just good songs.<br><br>In today’s golden age of APIs, nobody would be surprised if you used more than six APIs in a project. But, like songs, they all work slightly differently. You also have to remember which data is located in which API and what fields indicate a foreign key to another API.<br><br>What we need are API mashups. By stitching together multiple GraphQL schemas we can take away the overhead of having to remember where data is located and how to resolve references between them. In this talk, you’ll learn how to use schema stitching to annotate the GitHub API with metadata about the repositories and users in an organization, resulting in a more powerful API that’s ready to build great tooling with less effort.

                                In 2013, a number of employees at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory believed the tools that were so successfully supporting open source software could support development at JPL, too. Core to this belief was the theory that software development teams at JPL operated similarly to the open source community.<br><br>Known as innersource, this theory has been put into practice in a number of companies. Learn why JPL cares about innersource, how they champion open source development principles on GitHub Enterprise, and what progress they’ve made so far.

                                GitHub is more than a home for code. It’s a forum for collaboration, a sandbox for testing, a launchpad for deployment, and often, a platform for learning new skills. GitHub Learning Lab helps developer grow through active learning experiences without leaving GitHub. The app engages with students in issues and pull requests as they learn and guides them along their journey, responding to their activity and tracking their progress.<br><br>In this talk, we’ll share how we built Learning Lab using public GitHub APIs and Probot, a framework for building GitHub Apps. We’ll also share implementation details for reusable API abstractions - using these actions, you can build your own courses on Learning Lab to teach developers how you work, what your product or integration does, or something completely new.

                                GitHub Apps provides a new powerful and flexible way to integrate with GitHub. Both Code Climate and Travis CI have gone through the migration processes respectively, and are here to share their learnings.<br><br>We will be covering the benefits of GitHub apps, the challenges we encountered during the migrations, and some stories and learnings direct from the teams involved.

                                GitHub has shipped a lot of features in the past few months that you might not even know about. In this talk, I will show you some features that we’ve added to GitHub that you might not have known about, how you can use them as part of your day to day workflows, and dive a bit deeper into some of the new features we shared in our keynote.

                                In today’s news, technology and software are often maligned with stories of how technology is driving bias to eroding democracies to isolating communities. At the same time, the social problems we see in the world (climate change, poverty, etc.) are ever pervasive and persistent. Open source software can be an effective tool to address these pressing social issues of our time. It offers an even more compelling opportunity to develop and collaborate on software that is changing people’s lives. Come listen to developers who are working at the intersection of social change and technology. From the Gates Foundation’s work in expanding financial services to the world’s poor through open source to the Human Utility project’s efforts to address poverty in Detroit with software to Optikey’s revolutionary technology to help people with disabilities communicate, there is no shortage of opportunities for technology to do good in this world.

                                Lloyds Banking Group is a financial services group with millions of customers and a presence in nearly every UK community, both online and on the local high street. With more than one million businesses serviced through their brands, the hopes for creating the bank of the future is firmly locked in the sights of this digitally transforming organization.<br><br>In order to hit their ambitious goal, Lloyds Banking Group is changing from a traditionally introverted bank, hardened to risk through years of manual process, into an open and collaborative organization where innovation and experimentation are driven by engineering and automation.<br><br>During this talk you’ll learn how Lloyds Banking Group journeyed into innersource with the formation of engineering guilds and how this lead to the adoption of GitHub Enterprise from proof of concept to widespread use. We’ll also explore how engineering guilds formed the GitHub Enterprise Working Group to share successes and educate on best practices, while safeguarding the operation of their engineering community.<br><br>Finally, we’ll tell the story of how Lloyds Banking Group is moving fast toward open source, powered by the determination and ambition of engineers—and how GitHub Solutions Engineers are mentoring this enthusiasm to give back to the community.

                                Independently, the Visual Studio Code team at Microsoft and the editor tools team at GitHub began exploring the possibility of an integration between their two products. The team at Microsoft started to design a pull request experience within Visual Studio Code, while the GitHub team prototyped one modeled after the same experience in the Visual Studio IDE. By chance, the two teams met and showed each other nearly identical prototypes. The coincidence sparked the collaboration that brought you an integrated GitHub experience in Visual Studio Code supported by the Visual Studio Code API.<br><br>In this session, you’ll get an overview of how two companies worked together to support collaborative and open source development. You’ll also hear about the latest features and learn how you can contribute.

                                One of the greatest advantages for leaders in AI innovation comes from the ability to quickly bring cutting-edge research to large-scale production. Earlier this year, Facebook announced the roadmap for PyTorch 1.0. Continuing in the open source spirit of its predecessors, PyTorch 1.0 is being developed completely in the open with contributors from major academic and industry research institutes, utilizing open source platforms and tools such as GitHub, Jenkins, Conda, and Python PIP. PyTorch 1.0 combines the scalability of Caffe2 with PyTorch’s flexible front end to create a multi-faceted deep learning system that delivers an accelerated end-to-end research-to-production experience. Come learn about PyTorch 1.0, and how it can help you embed AI into your workflow with strong GitHub community support.

                                Airlines have on-time arrival. Retail has sales per square foot. Marketing teams have cost per acquisition. Manufacturing has yield and safety scores. But how do we measure the performance of engineering teams, and why is understanding team performance important?<br><br>This session looks at anonymized team data to share insights, behaviors, and metrics that help teams build better software, faster. We'll examine the anonymized, aggregate data from millions of builds for best practices on commits, pull requests, disaster recovery, frequency of deploy, and more.

                                How can large companies build like the open source community? Eli Lilly struck out on a journey to create a more open developer community—one that encourages sharing, drives code reuse, and builds better software, faster than ever.<br><br>In this session, you’ll learn how engineering teams at Eli Lilly shifted from locked down repositories to open collaboration and automated service offerings, along with a few tips and tricks for working better together. You’ll also hear how automation supported teams as they adopted GitHub Business Cloud and made it simple for engineers across the organization to configure repositories, enforce security policies, and more.

                                Airbnb has grown exponentially over the last few years—and so has their codebase. Most of Airbnb's code lives in a monolithic Rails application called Monorail. Despite having hundreds of contributors, the team is still able to ship fast and frequently. Hear some of the unique challenges Airbnb faces as their engineering team grows and see how they plan to transition toward a service-oriented architecture—a multi-year effort involving hundreds of engineers across the company.

                                Just as GitHub empowers developers to collaborate more effectively on code, GraphQL empowers developers to collaborate more effectively on APIs. Since Facebook open-sourced the technology in 2015, GraphQL has taken the industry by storm and GraphQL APIs are in production or underway at enterprise, media, and tech companies alike, including Github. Apollo has been driving the future of GraphQL and the app development workflow, enabling a thriving open source community on Github and building integrations between GraphQL and other developer tools.<br><br>Taking inspiration from GitHub's approach to code collaboration, we wanted to build a tool for collaborating on GraphQL APIs in a similar way. We landed on a feature for recommending, implementing, and approving changes to GraphQL schemas, which developers can hook directly into CI! Along with other tools offered by the GitHub developer platform, we used the GitHub Checks API to build this feature out, just days after its announcement.<br><br>In this talk, we'll dive into the software collaboration space and take a look at how teams collaborate on building and consuming APIs via GitHub today. We'll take a look at the nuts and bolts of how we've used the GitHub platform and the Checks API to enhance this collaboration with an API management and collaboration tool. Finally, we'll explore the next steps for expanding GitHub and Apollo's shared vision of enhancing software collaboration. Throughout the talk, I plan on using the GitHub GraphQL API itself as our prototypical example to tie the story together.

                                How is the global tech community preparing the software engineers who will lead the global tech revolution in ten years? With Africa projected to account for half the world's population growth by 2050 and 7 of 10 of the world’s fastest growing internet populations, U.S. venture firms are increasingly investing in African startups and paying serious attention to tech on the continent.<br><br>In the session, Andela Co-founder &amp; Director of Engineer Brice Nkengsa will delve into how African startups are building tech ecosystems across the continent to solve big problems, from food scarcity to clean water access. In addition, Brice will explore how today’s young African leaders are leveraging e-learning and community building to create more software engineers and catalyze a generation of diverse tech pioneers who will go on build the solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges.

                                Azure Pipelines is Microsoft’s new fully-managed CI/CD service and it’s free for open source projects and supports any language or framework. In this demo-heavy session, you'll learn how to build your open source projects using Azure Pipeline’s Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using our cloud-hosted Windows, Linux and Mac build agents. We’ll also explore how to deploy to Azure or any cloud using the same service.

                                The pillars of observability have long been accepted as key components of any microservice-in-production. But what about those new products—those new features—that have yet to be released? Properly instrumenting and leveraging metrics at this stage is perhaps even more crucial. When a product is yet to be released, identifying and addressing early bugs is critical.<br><br>See how the team at Digital Ocean leveraged Prometheus to properly instrument and test features within their software-defined networking pillar. This session will highlight instrumentation, key visualizations, and takeaways from their experience. You’ll also hear about areas for improvement and find out how to use these learnings for your own releases.
